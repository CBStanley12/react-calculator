## Project Status
This project is currently: _In Progress_

## Features
Complete:
- [X] Perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- [X] Clear the calculator's input using the 'AC' button

To-Do:
- [ ] Implement the percent operator to turn whole numbers to decimals
- [ ] Implement the sign operator to change numbers from positive to negative and vice versa
- [ ] Persist recent calculations in localStorage
- [ ] Display calculations from localStorage in a 'History' display area
- [ ] Implement a 'C' button to clear only the calculator's input
- [ ] Refactor the 'AC' button to clear the calculator's input and history (localStorage)

User Stories Fulfilled:

- [X] User Story #1: My calculator should contain a clickable element containing an = (equal sign) with a corresponding id="equals"
- [X] User Story #2: My calculator should contain 10 clickable elements containing one number each from 0-9, with the following corresponding IDs: id="zero", id="one", id="two", id="three", id="four", id="five", id="six", id="seven", id="eight", and id="nine"
- [X] User Story #3: My calculator should contain 4 clickable elements each containing one of the 4 primary mathematical operators with the following corresponding IDs: id="add", id="subtract", id="multiply", id="divide"
- [X] User Story #4: My calculator should contain a clickable element containing a . (decimal point) symbol with a corresponding id="decimal"
- [X] User Story #5: My calculator should contain a clickable element with an id="clear"
- [X] User Story #6: My calculator should contain an element to display values with a corresponding id="display"
- [X] User Story #7: At any time, pressing the clear button clears the input and output values, and returns the calculator to its initialized state; 0 should be shown in the element with the id of display
- [X] User Story #8: As I input numbers, I should be able to see my input in the element with the id of display
- [X] User Story #9: In any order, I should be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide a chain of numbers of any length, and when I hit =, the correct result should be shown in the element with the id of display
- [X] User Story #10: When inputting numbers, my calculator should not allow a number to begin with multiple zeros
- [X] User Story #11: When the decimal element is clicked, a . should append to the currently displayed value; two . in one number should not be accepted
- [X] User Story #12: I should be able to perform any operation (+, -, *, /) on numbers containing decimal points
- [X] User Story #13: If 2 or more operators are entered consecutively, the operation performed should be the last operator entered
- [X] User Story #14: Pressing an operator immediately following = should start a new calculation that operates on the result of the previous evaluation
- [X] User Story #15: My calculator should have several decimal places of precision when it comes to rounding (note that there is no exact standard, but you should be able to handle calculations like 2 / 7 with reasonable precision to at least 4 decimal places)
